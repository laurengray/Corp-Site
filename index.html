        <div class="bio-body">
          <p>In 2004, Jill Layﬁeld stumbled upon a posting for a marketing position with a small eCommerce company called backcountry.com and decided to send in her resume. Little did she know she would not only uproot from the San Francisco Bay area to Park City, UT, but that she would also move up through the ranks from Backcountry's Director of Customer Marketing role to become the VP of Product Development in 2009, COO in 2010, and CEO in 2011.</p>
          <p>Jill graduated from Santa Clara University with a B.A. in Communications. Prior to Backcountry, Jill held positions with Shutterfly, Cisco Systems, Infogear, and 8x8.</p>
          <p>When she’s not tearing down the Backcountry hallway to her next meeting, Jill loves to climb, trail run, ski, and mountain bike with her family. Her husband, daughters, and dog are her constant companions in the outdoors, and she wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

          <p>Jill's very first climbing rope remains her most cherished piece of outdoor gear. It was given to her as a gift before a climb in the Sierra Foothills many years ago, and the scars she's acquired while using it—one being a heart-shaped mark on the back of her left hand—serve to remind her of her love for the sport.</p>

          <h5>Ted's Gear Story:</h5>
          <p>Ted’s three-layer Patagonia Gore-Tex patrol parka is literally stained with memories.  From sheave train grease to spilled beer and blood stains, it’s a garment covered in the residue of early mornings, miserable weather, and stabilized injuries.  He’s worn it to weddings and funerals.  It’s never stopped doing its job of keeping the elements out and the warmth in; and even more, it’s come to symbolize his love of the snow and his commitment to his patrol friends, his family, and his service to others.</p>

          <em>EVP of Operations</em>

        <div class="bio-body">
          <p>Pete LaBore originally joined the Backcountry team in 2007 to serve as the Director of Customer Acquisition; it was a role that would later serve as the beacon to bring him back to the team in 2010, after a brief departure.</p>
          <p>Early in his career, Pete served as the head of Internet Marketing for JC Whitney, where he developed a strong foundation of marketing and eCommerce. Later, his transition to the online marketing agency, Performics, led him to oversee the online marketing strategy and performance for clients such as Toyota, FTD.com, and Patagonia.</p>
          <p>After a brief move back to Chicago, Pete rejoined Backcountry in 2010, first serving as the Director of Customer Retention before taking over the Flash and Dogfunk segments of the business. Today, Pete's role as General Manager gives him direct responsibility for the operations of Backcountry, including P&amp;L, fulfillment and customer service, and those of dogfunk, Competitive Cyclist, and Backcountry's Flash businesses including Steep&amp;cheap, Chainlove, and Whiskey Militia. His deep understanding of eCommerce across all disciplines makes him an integral part of Backcountry's core leadership team. </p>
          <p>Pete earned his B.A. in Mechanical Engineering from Iowa State University and his MBA in Strategy &amp; Marketing from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. When he's not at the office, Pete enjoys spending time skiing, trail running and fly-fishing, and being outside with his wife, Nicole, and 4-year-old son, Beck.</p>

          <h5>Pete's Gear Story:</h5>
          <p>Fly fishing was always on Pete’s bucket list; so, one day he picked up a Sage fly rod, bought rods for his dad and his brother, and planned a trip to fish small creeks in the southwest region of Wisconsin. The trip provided a unique opportunity for the family to bond and cemented fly fishing as an escape for Pete. Now, with larger rivers to fish in Utah, the Sage One is his trout fishing weapon of choice. In the end, fly fishing has proved a ticket to get away from it all.</p>

        <div class="bio-body">
          <p>Jim Holland is a two-time Olympian and six-time national champion Nordic ski jumper. Holland was a member of the US Ski Team for nine years, and he continues to be an avid athlete in all aspects.</p>
          <p>After graduating from the University of Vermont, Jim migrated to Utah and founded the web development company Wasatch Web Works. The company would serve as his introduction to online business, and it would eventually lead him to team up with the co-founder of backcountry.com, John Bresee. Jim’s focus on cost-effective retailing led to exceptional year-over-year growth for Backcountry, and his passion for specialty outdoor gear has helped Backcountry stand apart from its competition.</p>
          <p>From rallying company Ultimate Frisbee games at lunch to long adventurous backcountry ski tours, Jim approaches everything outdoors with the same passion and focus that has made backcountry.com the success it is today.</p>

          <p>Jim’s favorite pieces of gear are his Black Diamond Justice skis and his Ortovox avalanche beacon. He appreciates the avalanche beacon for what it represents—a means for expanding the boundaries of where you can go and what you can do. He’s taken both the skis and the beacon on many trips, one of the most memorable of which was a winter trek from sea level to the top of the 11,000ft peak in Jackson Hole called The Skillet.</p>

          <p>Shae McCowen has over 15 years of experience in Planning and Merchandising.  He came to Backcountry.com from Target where, as the Senior Director for Merchandise Planning, he was responsible for Target’s eCommerce and mobile platforms. Shae also led Target’s Merchandising team in India.  He’s excited about his role at Backcountry.com (he calls it his “dream job”) because it allows him to balance his career with his passion for the outdoors.</p>
          <p>Backpacking and cycling are among Shae’s many outdoor interests. He’s trekked to Everest base camp where he spent five nights above 14,000 feet, and most recently hiked with his wife through Patagonia.  Perhaps most impressively, Shae managed to ride his bike nearly every day this past year, even through the deep cold of a Minnesota winter. </p>

          <h5>Shae's Gear Story:</h5>
          <p>When asked how he could possibly ride his bike through a Minnesota winter, Shae readily credits his Arc’teryx Gamma MX Softshell Jacket. His favorite thing about the jacket is its ability to handle a broad range of temperatures and its perfect fit—even for a guy who’s six-foot five. When his son poked a hole through his favorite jacket on a camping trip, Shae didn’t hesitate to replace it with another Gamma MX.</p>

          <em>SVP of Marketing</em>

        <div class="bio-body">
          <p>Working at Backcountry.com is Brandon Warburton’s dream job—it’s the opportunity to combine his passion for the outdoors with his expertise in ecommerce, all while living in the mountains. Prior to landing in Park City, Brandon honed his business and marketing skills at multiple companies, including IAC, Ancestry.com, Citysearch, and the U.S. Ski Team. His career at Backcountry began with a bang, as he arrived in the middle of the fourth-quarter holiday frenzy of 2008 and had to hit the ground running. The company has grown in the six years he’s been here, and he’s thankful to have been a part of the development. </p>
          <p>When Brandon’s not overseeing Backcountry’s marketing operations, he can be found skiing or mountain biking in the surrounding Wasatch Range or fly fishing in streams and rivers throughout Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. Skiing was his focus growing up, and he honed his skills while racing at the Rowmark Ski Academy in Salt Lake City. It wasn’t until he arrived at the University of Colorado, Boulder that cycling and fly fishing started to absorb more of his time, and both have provided years of enjoyment since. Most recently Brandon’s focus has shifted towards his young family. He’s excited to introduce his two girls to the outdoors and spend time with them and his wife skiing, camping, fly fishing, and biking.</p>

          <h5>Brandon's Gear Story:</h5>
          <p>Brandon’s Simms waders have seen a lot of use&mdash;over 100 days in the past two years&mdash;but they’re still going strong. Brandon appreciates the breathability of the wader’s Gore-Tex Pro Shell when he’s fishing on hot days and the generous bib storage that eliminates the need for a vest. “I’ve put these waders through the wringer,” says Brandon. “They’ve survived many days on the river and even a few run-ins with barbed wire fences.” It’s little surprise that these waders have become Brandon’s go-to choice for fly fishing here in Utah and beyond.</p>
