        <div class="bio-body">
          <p>In 2004, Jill Layﬁeld stumbled upon a posting for a marketing position with a small eCommerce company called backcountry.com and decided to send in her resume. Little did she know she would not only uproot from the San Francisco Bay area to Park City, UT, but that she would also move up through the ranks from Backcountry's Director of Customer Marketing role to become the VP of Product Development in 2009, COO in 2010, and CEO in 2011.</p>
          <p>Jill graduated from Santa Clara University with a B.A. in Communications. Prior to Backcountry, Jill held positions with Shutterfly, Cisco Systems, Infogear, and 8x8.</p>
          <p>When she’s not tearing down the Backcountry hallway to her next meeting, Jill loves to climb, trail run, ski, and mountain bike with her family. Her husband, daughters, and dog are her constant companions in the outdoors, and she wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

          <p>Jill's very first climbing rope remains her most cherished piece of outdoor gear. It was given to her as a gift before a climb in the Sierra Foothills many years ago, and the scars she's acquired while using it—one being a heart-shaped mark on the back of her left hand—serve to remind her of her love for the sport.</p>

          <p>Since joining the company, Kevin quickly took to the trails around the backcountry.com office&mdash;trails that lead him to acquire a Santa Cruz Tallboy 29er. Having previously cut almost 20 minutes off his Xterra triathlon time on a 29er, he didn’t hesitate to pull the trigger on the Tallboy. With this efficient, capable hill-climbing machine, he spends much of his time exploring the Mid-Mountain trail in Park City or riding to the Crest Trail in Big Cottonwood Canyon.</p>

          <p>Pete LaBore originally joined the Backcountry herd in 2007 to serve as the Director of Customer Acquisition; it was a role that would later serve as the beacon to bring him back to the herd in 2010, after a brief departure.</p>
          <p>Early in his career, Pete served as the head of Internet Marketing for JC Whitney, where he developed a strong foundation of marketing and eCommerce. Later, his transition to the online marketing agency, Performics, led him to oversee the online marketing strategy and performance for clients such as Toyota, FTD.com, and Patagonia.</p>
          <p>After a brief move back to Chicago, Pete rejoined Backcountry in 2010, first serving as the Director of Customer Retention before taking over the P&amp;L for the Flash (one deal at a time) and Dogfunk segments of the business. Today, Pete's role within the executive team involves leading merchandising and Flash operations. His deep understanding of eCommerce across marketing, merchandising, and product makes him an integral part of Backcountry's core leadership team.</p>
          <p>Pete earned his B.A. in Mechanical Engineering from Iowa State University and his MBA in Strategy &amp; Marketing from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.

The trip provided a unique opportunity for the family to bond and cemented fly fishing as an escape for Pete. Now, with larger rivers to fish in Utah, the Sage One is his trout fishing weapon of choice. In the end, fly fishing has proved a ticket to get away from it all.</p>

        <h2>Gear</h2>
        <p>Gear is at the heart of our business, so we offer deep discounts, pro deals, and a gear closet for lending so you can own the best and test the latest.

        <p>And best of all, workday recreation is highly encouraged; a mid-day ride on the bike, a morning of skiing neck-deep powder, or an early afternoon climb are all part of who we are.  </p>
